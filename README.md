# R-Bagging-Boosting-RandomForest-Computer1995-Dataset

This paper is based on the analysis contained in Chapter 8 of Tbishirani's book "Introduction to Statistical Learning (with Applications in R)" [1].

The dataset considered for the analysis is taken from the paper by Stengos and Zacharias [2] and contains price, listing month and technical specifications 
of a number of PCs observed between 1993 and 1995.

The objective is to estimate the price of the pcs through tree regression models, trying to understand whether pruning, bagging, 
random forest and boosting techniques can help improve the result of the predictions made on the test set.
